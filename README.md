## Process

### 1. Idea

Outside of our office, there's a duck pond next to a construction site. One day, one of the construction workers was telling us how a duck had nested in the construction site. When the baby ducklings hatched, he had to get the babies across the street safely to the duck pond.

Nick Sung, Story Artist at Wonder Unit, imagined what that scene might be like in this wonderful short sequence.

### 7. Put in timing and dialogue, metadata

## Working with GitHub for version control and teams

Storyboarder files are easy to commit to github because the storyboarder file is text, which works really well in Git.
We also commit the imagery into git as well, the files are fairly small.

You can ignore the exports folder using a .gitignore.

Using GitHub for Desktop, it makes it easy to work on a team with artists who aren't even that tech savvy.
